"Automotive door control system design" Project:
----------------------

1. Regarding the requirement "You should draw the state machine for each (ECU1 & ECU2) component",
   The state machine diagrams for all SW components are in the 2 folders "ECU_1_Components_State_Diagrams" & "ECU_2_Components_State_Diagrams".
   
   What exactly is meant by "ECU Component" ?
   
   such as the "BCM" and "CAN_If" SW component etc. ?
   
   or what is meant are the HW components such as "light switch" and "Buzzer" etc. ?
